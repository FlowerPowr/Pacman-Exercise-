<h1>Pacman Exercise</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
I created a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page
Here’s how the game is played:
When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

How to Run: Follow instructions in description. 



Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to actually get the images to swicth directions, I dont know why I can only use one image?
